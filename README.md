# Data 1202: Data Analytics Tools
This Jupyter Notebook is designed for a lab exercise focusing on two primary objectives:

-   Learning the use of `iloc` for subsetting a dataset.
-   Learning how to create functions in Python.
## Getting started

This is a Python project developed using Jupyter Notebook. Below are the step-by-step instructions on how to set it up on your PC and get started.
### Prerequisites

You will need the following utilities installed on your system:

-   **Jupyter lab:** JupyterLab is an open-source web-based interactive development environment (IDE) designed for data science, scientific computing, and machine learning tasks, among other things. Follow the instrucutions on how to install here: [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
-   **numpy package** - NumPy is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
-   **pandas package** - Pandas is a Python library that provides high-level data structures and data analysis tools. It is built on top of NumPy and is particularly well-suited for working with labeled and relational data
-   `pip install numpy pandas`
    

### Installing:

1. First clone this repository using the "git clone" command as shown below:
`https://github.com/lovepreetkaur-778/Git-Assignment.git`
2. Use Jupyter Lab to open the project using the command below.
`jupyter-lab Lab6_week8 .ipynb`
3. The project will open on your browser and you can start writng your Python code.
## Running Tests
If you're testing code within a Jupyter notebook, you can simply execute the code cells containing your tests.
- Follow this steps:
- Write your test code in one or more cells.
- Execute the cells containing your test code by clicking on them and then pressing Shift + Enter or by clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar.
- For example, you might have cells like this:
```
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np

# Define a simple function to test
def test_addition():
    assert np.add(1, 2) == 3

# Run the test
test_addition()
```
## Deployment

To deploy this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git`
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
`cd your-project`
3. Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Lab installed. Refere to the "Getting Started" section above
4. Launch Jupyter Lab:
`jupyter-lab Lab6_week8 .ipynb`
5. Access the Project:
Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (typically http://localhost:8888) to access Jupyter Lab. You can now open and run the project notebooks.
